#Welcome to GitHub Pages.

Hello! I'm NGUYEN Khac-Dung (Kevin), and this is my GitHub Pages home page. It's still filled mostly with helpful hints from GitHub, and needs a lot of work!

$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages

If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.
Designer Templates

We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.

## Rather Drive Stick?

If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named gh-pages to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.
Authors and Contributors

You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <a> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nguyenkhacdung/nguyenkhacdung.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nguyenkhacdung/nguyenkhacdung.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
